**Code for the project “Comparing Forecast Performance on Large Panel Data with Unknown Clustering Structure”**

This repository contains the R code developed for a research project that compares forecast performance in large panel datasets where the clustering structure is unknown. It includes data preparation, model fitting, statistical testing and visualisation scripts.

---

## 📂 Contents

The repository currently includes:

- Data preparation scripts (`CDS_data_prep.R`, `expl_variables_prep.R`)  
- Model stimation script (`model_fits.R`)
- Scripts for Diebold-Mariano test with thresholded covariance matrix scripts (`hac_hard_threshold_sigma.R`, `test.R`)  
- Descriptive statistics of the data (`summary_statistics.R`)  
- Visualisation scripts (`visualisations.R`)  

Each script is designed to be run in sequence or as part of a custom analysis pipeline.
